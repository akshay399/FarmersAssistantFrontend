      "<p>This article will provide information and proven methods for identifying, preventing, and controlling mosaic disease in your plants and gardens.</p>",
      "<p>The mosaic virus is a parasite that destroys plants, gardens, and crops down to their molecular level. Once a plant contracts the mosaic virus, the infected plant can then spread the virus to other plants and even affect an entire harvest if left untreated.</p>",
      "<p>Mosaic viruses affect a wide variety of horticultural and vegetable crops\u00a0\u2014\u00a0roses, beans, tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, squash, melons, and peppers.</p>",

      "<p>The typical symptoms of the mosaic virus include:</p>",
      "<p>Plant viruses can\u00a0be difficult to detect as these typical symptoms look similar to other plants with nutrient deficiencies and vary depending on the age of the plant when infection occurs.

Aphids are the most common garden pests, so learning about <a href=\"https://www.planetnatural.com/organic-control-aphids/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">aphid control</a> is an extremely important part of any garden or harvest. Additionally, infected soil, seeds, starter pots, and containers\u00a0can be infected and pass a virus particle to the plant.

In most cases, infected plants will germinate and come up fine, but within a few days they become water-soaked and mushy, fall over at the base and die.</p>",
      "<p>Several fungi can cause decay of seeds and seedlings including species of <em>rhizoctonia</em>, <em>fusarium</em> and <em>phytophthora</em>. However, species of the soil fungus <em>pythium</em> are most often the culprit. Damping off typically occurs when old seed is planted in cold, wet soil and is further increased by poor soil drainage. High humidity levels, rich potting soils and planting too deeply will also encourage its growth.</p>",

      "<p>Cedar apple rust (<em>Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae</em>) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees.</p>",

    "data": [
      "<p>Black knot is a widespread fungal disease that attacks plum and cherry trees, both fruiting and ornamental. The fungus, <em>Apiosporina morbosa</em>, (also identified as <em>Dibotryon morbosum</em> and <em>Plowrightia morbsum</em>), singles out trees of the genus <em>prunus</em>, which includes peach, apricot, and chokecherry. Once established, black knot is easily identified with its hard, uneven, black galls that seem to enwrap twigs and branches. Black knot is a slow developer, taking a season before it\u2019s visually apparent and producing spores. The trick to controlling the fungus is identifying the infection well-before the disease becomes firmly established. If left to grow, it effectively strangles new growth, girdling branches and dooming the tree to deterioration and poor fruit production. Insects and plant diseases use the galls as an entry to the tree.</p>",
      "<p>The disease cycle starts when spores are released from established knots where the fungus overwinters. This occurs during damp spring conditions when temperatures reach 60 degrees or higher. The spores travel to other parts of the tree and, depending on the breezes, to nearby host trees. The spores germinate on stems beneath a thin film of moisture, often at the juncture of a new leaf start. They form small, olive-colored swellings over the first season, darkening in color as the season progresses, hidden by the leaves they\u2019ll eventually kill,. By the second year, the galls are expanding quickly, especially where the weather remains humid. The growing infection begins releasing its own spores as it swells into the dark, easy-to-spot (especially after leaves have fallen) warty black fungus that coils along stems and branches. At this point, astute pruning and chemical treatments may not be enough to save the tree, no matter how careful the pruner is not to spread spores or leave them behind when removing the galls.</p>",
      "<p>Paying close attention to your fruit trees and catching the infections as soon as they\u2019re apparent, followed by quick pruning and careful disposal of the gall-infected branches, can save trees. Organic treatments can also help protect trees while keeping harmful chemicals off your fruit.</p>",
      "<p>When choosing new plantings, consider that some varieties of tree and shrubs are more susceptible to the disease than others. They should be avoided in areas where the fungus is prolific. Tart cherry varieties are said to be less susceptible to the disease than sweet. Japanese plums are said to be less susceptible than American varieties. A number of plums, including President, Early Italian, Santa Rosa and Shiro carry varying degrees of resistance to the fungus. Susceptibility varies depending on the climate zones. Varieties that are susceptible in humid southern climates may be less so in dryer or cooler ones. Talk to your local nursery staff to see which varieties of plums, cherries, and ornamentals do best in your area. The Ohio State University Extension site has a chart on their <a href=\"https://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/plpath-fru-31\" target=\"_blank\">black knot page</a> that list the various levels for susceptibility to a number of plum and cherry tree varieties. (Not surprisingly, plum trees with resistance to black knot don\u2019t do well in cold, northern climates.)</p>"

      "<p>A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (<em>Venturia inaequalis</em>) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves. Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early in the summer.</p>",
      "<p>Symptoms on fruit are similar to those found on leaves. Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center. As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky. Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms. Severely affected fruit may drop, especially when young.</p>",
      "<p>Apple scab overwinters primarily in fallen leaves and in the soil. Disease development is favored by wet, cool weather that generally occurs in spring and early summer. Fungal spores are carried by wind, rain or splashing water from the ground to flowers, leaves or fruit. During damp or rainy periods, newly opening apple leaves are extremely susceptible to infection. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more severe the infection will be. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees F.</p>"

    "treatment": [
      "<li>Choose resistant varieties when possible.</li>",
      "<li>Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.</li>",
      "<li>Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.</li>",
      "<li>Spread a 3- to 6-inch\u00a0layer of compost\u00a0under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.</li>",
      "<li>For best control, spray <a href=\"https://www.planetnatural.com/product/liquid-copper-fungicide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">liquid copper soap</a> early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.</li>",

    "data": [
      "<p>Widely distributed throughout the United States, bacterial canker is most common on cherries and plums, but may also affect apricots, peaches and many other kinds of stone fruits. Suspect this plant disease if sunken, water-soaked or \u201cgummy\u201d lesions form on the trunk or twigs. When trees begin active growth in the spring, a sour smelling sap may ooze from these wounded areas. The cankers become darker than the surrounding healthy bark, and the underlying tissue is reddish-brown to black and moist.</p>",
      "<p><strong>Note:</strong> If cankers girdle the branches or trunk, the leaves above the diseased area curl and turn yellow. Growth stops and the branch or tree will eventually die.</p>",
      "<p>The bacterium that causes canker,\u00a0<em>Pseudomonas syringae</em>, enters trees through injured bark or an existing wound, such as a pruning cut on a twig or branch. Frost damage in the spring may promote additional infections. Bacterial canker infections occur during fall, winter and early spring (during cool, wet weather) and are spread by rain or water, and pruning tools. The bacteria overwinter in active cankers, in infected buds and on the surface of infected and healthy trees and weeds.</p>"
